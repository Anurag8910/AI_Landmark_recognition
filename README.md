üåç AI Landmark Recognition in Asia
Welcome to the AI Landmark Recognition Android app! This project uses a TensorFlow model trained to recognize famous landmarks across Asia. Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, the app provides an intuitive interface and high accuracy in identifying landmarks.


üì± Features
Landmark Recognition: Identify famous landmarks across Asia with high accuracy using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
Modern UI: Built with Jetpack Compose for a modern, responsive, and intuitive user interface.
Offline Functionality: The app runs offline, leveraging the pre-trained model to recognize landmarks without the need for an internet connection.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Kotlin: The primary programming language for Android development.
Jetpack Compose: Android's modern toolkit for building native UI.
TensorFlow Lite: Utilized for running the pre-trained AI model on-device.
Pre-trained Model: The model used for landmark recognition was sourced from Kaggle.
